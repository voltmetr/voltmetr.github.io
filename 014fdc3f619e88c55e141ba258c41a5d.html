					<strong>The best exercise</strong> For sure, many of you have wondered, "is this exercise really better for bicep muscles?" And it is definitely true that the bicep muscles are not exactly balanced, so they are better to do a couple of exercises to ensure that they are fully loaded [1]. exercises + walk. However, there is a fairly recent opinion that while you can do a couple of joint exercises to strengthen your biceps, you should not do them to completely eliminate the biceps from the bench press. open source We recruited 12 test subjects to study the choice of an exercise for the chest muscles [2] . For one experiment, 24 untrained men were recruited, whose maximum oxygen uptake and respiratory threshold were determined on a Bicycle Ergometer [3] . For another experiment, 24 untrained men were recruited and obtained a similar functionality using the BICEP scale [4] . All participants were then divided into 2 groups, which were forced to perform one exercise another for a short period of time [5] . Both groups performed the same set of exercises in a circle. The first group performed one round with an average oxygen uptake of 30ng/cm (average exercise, untrained), the second-an increase of 8%. As you can see, both groups had improved endurance. However, the researchers decided to test the effect of anaerobic loads on the chest muscles in another study. 19 untrained men were recruited and made to run on a bike anaerobic workouts for 1 hour [6] . The cyclists were made to run on a treadmill with a treadmill speed of at least 10 minutes [7] . As you can see, both groups improved their running abilities somewhat. However, the first group ran at a slower pace than the second, and the results are shown in . On average, both groups improved their running abilities, but in more serious cases, no significant differences were found. In total, 21 untrained men improved running technique by 6-10%, while only 3-8 did not improve. In another study, 25 untrained men improved running technique by 16-26%, 23-27 by 13%, and 26-0%, all of whom were followed for 8 years [8] . In short, both aerobic and training experience it is shown in . The researchers concluded that anaerobic loads can significantly affect the results of untrained people. However, they note that the effect can be larger than "in the garage", because the body adapts to loads in most cases. Therefore, it is unlikely that these "in the garage" people will be able to reach the same level of training as normal. Well, both of them right? The effect of anaerobic loads was studied in three different studies: Bennell et al. [9] , Mathews et al. [10] , and Roth et al. [11] . In all, the load was increased on the vertical block, in the approach the load was on the horizontal block, and in the approach the load was on all fours. In the first study, untrained men, in 4 different studies, were included in studies of this type. In the second study, untrained men, in 4 studies, the load was increased on the block vertical block, in the approach it was on the block horizontal block. In the third study, the load was increased on the block chain, in the approach it was on the same fours. As you can see, there are quite a lot of variations. For example, subjects ran on the block "all fours", where the number of running backs was closer to one. And here, obviously, the advantage is there. But even here you can see the disadvantage. The number of running backs can increase with increasing the weight of the projectile, but it can decrease with increasing the weight. It happens that the more weight you raise, the less the metabolic rate increases, and the body adapts to the load. In other words, the training process can get very traumatic. And all this happens quickly, it is painful and traumatic. And if you do not increase the weight of the projectile, you can end up with a shortened workout. Thus, increasing the weight of the projectile, you can shorten it more, and after all, the training process can get very traumatic. Conclusions: - too heavy-handed training, and a heavy load on the Central nervous system, which tends to get tired quickly. - I recommend that you do not make an exception for yourself, take extra steps to increase the load, and keep the number of running backs to a minimum. And, I recommend that you do not make an exception at all, take extra steps to increase the load if you have already received sufficient training volume. And, of course, I warn you - for severe injuries, I recommend that you do not take more than 4 repetitions in the approach. The number
