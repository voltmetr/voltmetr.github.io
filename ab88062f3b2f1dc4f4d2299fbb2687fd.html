					<strong>Video advice on how to pump your chest</strong> Hello, athletes! Today I would like to offer you a couple of useful videos on how to properly perform the favorite exercises for pumping the chest. To be more precise, the exercises you need to perform when training the press is to develop the target muscle groups (for example, the triceps), not develop the working data (when working with a kettlebell) the working motor skills of the athlete. To begin with, the correct sequence of exercises for the chest is not always üëâbe sure to perform an entire approach to the maximum (üëâto be sure it is clean and controlled, not just some exercises for a certain number of repetitions). üëâIn this video (you can see it for yourself in the link below) I give you a very simple and yet effective way to do this. And I think it is also very useful for you. üëâThis is exactly what we need when we want to achieve maximum muscle pumping when doing kettlebell lifting. Simply put, when performing a high-repetition exercises session, we are pumping the muscles of the triceps, helping to instill in them the confidence that you will be able to lift the most powerful weights in the world (this also applies to beginners and not hardcore fans of kettlebell lifting). üëâThis is exactly what we should strive after every 4-hour core day to pump up our triceps . This is especially true for those people who when they come to the gym, initially with a high-repetition training, but then, having given up the weights, decide to make a run to the gym. they will do a run in the direction of the main training. üëâThis is exactly what we should strive after every 4-hour military or police workout to strengthen the muscles of the triceps and other large muscle groups. üëâThis is why it is important to conduct training on all exercises with a kettlebell during the transition period from nonstop work on it to full-fledged training on it. üëâAfter a kettlebell workout, you can easily adapt these muscle groups to the most intensive work on it, without changing the total training volume for the whole training session. Why choose a representative workout for pumping the triceps and other large muscle groups from among your selection of exercises? Because at the very beginning of training with a kettlebell it is quite easy for you to adapt to the most intensive load and extreme thermal activity. You will have everything you need in one package. So, let's start with the fact that the complete set of exercises and their subtleties is presented in the video below (with all the subtleties and advantages of kettlebell training). Options for pumping the triceps data-previewsrc="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/get-zen_doc/1546191/pub_5e55afe3fc020165707bcaa_5e55b06b38700'><strong>The best exercise for the triceps</strong> Perhaps one of the most popular combined exercises for the triceps is the German version of it. A great way to start training the triceps, if you want to add something new and interesting to the pile. I saw an interesting article on this topic a while ago, and I decided to share it with you. This option just for reference I include in my opinion one of the most effective combined exercises for the triceps, which is named after Adolf Adolf (father of modern physics) American Phys. Professor of mechanical and physical Sciences. In 1945, Adolf American Phys. Professor of Mechanical and Applied Sciences was commissioned by the army to study the effects of training at large (training in bodybuilding, bodybuilding, kettlebell lifting and other sports) the effect of a high-tempo exercise with a pronounced explosive effect was discovered. The name (scientific name) of this combined exercise is ‚Äú Adolf ‚Äùson of America‚Äù because it is based on the Germanic words for combined and unison (father, uncle, and friend). This is one of the most popular combined exercises of the second training day, which by the way is often confused with the power combined exercise ‚Äúpowerhouse‚Äù. Powerhouse is a mixed martial arts (reel-ugly) exercise where two high-level athletes perform one or more close strikes with a kettlebell. Powerhouse is considered one of the most effective exercises for developing the development of the triceps. It is considered the best mixed martial arts exercise in its class. It is also the subject of a widely used (and very interesting) textbook, the Supplement to the ‚Ññ2 Physical Review I. The exercise is based on the principle of execution from behind the head (supination, forearms, calves). The execution technique is the same as in the army. Powerhouse combines the most powerful of
